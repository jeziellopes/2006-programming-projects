## Time Travel üï∞Ô∏è

It's amusing to reflect on how I built this repository from a time when I couldn't even imagine that one day I would be sharing it on a Git repository ‚Äî **and now, making it Open Source**. Looking back, those steps were crucial in shaping my technical skills, paving the way for the technology I deliver today. 

## Warning WW ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Disclaimer:** I cannot guarantee the cleanliness and completeness of the .exe files contained in this repository. As you explore, you'll notice that I've implemented an old-fashioned antidote approach for some trojans along the way. Feel free to experiment, but proceed with caution and use at **your own risk**.
